This README serves to document and explain my thoughts and journey in building this project. As such, it might be a bit informal in tone.

## Overview 

This build was created for my final project build of my WGU Javascript Programming class.

Because I am learning a new javascript framework entirely, I didn't add any additional personal goals to learn during this project. I found myself struggling and hammering away at this project for much longer than I initially anticipated, and by the end I tried to focus more on functionality and learning the framework besides trying to make the application look presentable. There is no focus on creating breakpoints for this project, so for reference, this was created and styled on a monitor that has a resolution width higher than 1600px.

With this project, I unfortunately didn't document and log my hours as closely as previous projects. I will admit however, this small project did take me about a month to complete as I was consistently frustrated trying to search for appropriate documentation and stack overflow forums to help. A majority of the time, the documentation would only get me part of the way to where I needed to be, and it seemed like none of the stack overflow threads would ever fully answer the questions I had. Each thread had answers that used deprecated content or the answers were too far off the mark for what I needed. 

### The Project 

Some requirements for this project include: 

- utilizing an SVG map of the world to use as the visual interface
- Make the SVG map interactive by utilizing mouse event handlers so that *each* path is recognized
- Use either the GeoNames or Worldbank API to identify country names, country capitals, income levels, etc.
- Generate and API service that uses the built-in Angular HTTP client Module (NOT ```fetch```)
